## Initialize my game

Once you [installed Eole environment](../install), you'll have to develop a backend and a frontend.


### Game folders

Game can be developped in:

- **Backend**: `eole-api/src/Eole/Games/MyGame/`
- **Frontend**: `eole-angular/eole/games/my-game/`

Note that there is already a folder "my game" in both backend and frontend. You can start from them or create a new ones.
